Data-Driven Salary Prediction for Data Professionals.
<br>
The objective of this data analysis project was to construct a reliable model capable of predicting the salary ranges for various positions within the data domain, leveraging a dataset comprised of numerous job listings. The project was undertaken in a series of methodical steps to ensure the accuracy and validity of the model's predictions.
<br>
<br>
Initially, the dataset presented a broad spectrum of features including company ratings, size, founding year, industry sector, revenue, competitors, and job-specific requirements such as title, seniority, and necessary technical skills. The dataset's richness and diversity required a meticulous approach to preprocessing to enhance model performance.
